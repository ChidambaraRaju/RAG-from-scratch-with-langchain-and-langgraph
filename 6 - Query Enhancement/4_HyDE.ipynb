    "\n",
    "**In the previous notebooks**, we explored query enhancement techniques like **Query Expansion** (making a query more detailed) and **Query Decomposition** (breaking a complex query into simpler parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook**, we'll learn about a third, fundamentally different technique: **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**. Instead of modifying the user's query text, HyDE generates a completely new, hypothetical document that answers the query. We then use the embedding of this *hypothetical answer* to find real, factual documents in our knowledge base. This is a powerful method for bridging the semantic gap between a question and its answer."

    "HyDE is a retrieval technique where, instead of embedding the user’s query directly, you first generate a hypothetical answer (document) to the query using an LLM. You then embed that hypothetical document to search your vector store. The core idea is that a hypothetical answer is likely to be much closer in the vector space to the real answer documents than the original question is.\n",

    "1.  Queries are short or ambiguous.\n",
    "2.  There is a language mismatch between the query and the documents (e.g., question vs. statement).\n",
