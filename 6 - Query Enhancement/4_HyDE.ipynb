    "**In the previous notebooks**, we explored query enhancement techniques like **Query Expansion** (making a query more detailed) and **Query Decomposition** (breaking a complex query into simpler parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook**, we'll learn about a third, fundamentally different technique: **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**. Instead of modifying the user's query text, HyDE generates a completely new, hypothetical document that answers the query. We then use the embedding of this *hypothetical answer* to find real, factual documents in our knowledge base. This is a powerful method for bridging the semantic gap between a question and its answer."

    "HyDE is a retrieval technique where, instead of embedding the user‚Äôs query directly, you first generate a hypothetical answer (document) to the query using an LLM. You then embed that hypothetical document to search your vector store. The core idea is that a hypothetical answer is likely to be much closer in the vector space to the real answer documents than the original question is.\n",
