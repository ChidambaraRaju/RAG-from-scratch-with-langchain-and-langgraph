    "PDFs are one of the most common document formats, but they can be tricky. Unlike a plain `.txt` file, a PDF is a complex format that can contain text, images, tables, and complex layouts. Extracting text accurately is the first major hurdle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Think of a `.txt` file as a simple typed letter, where all the text is in a clear, linear order. A PDF, on the other hand, is like a glossy magazine page. The text might be in different columns, wrapped around images, or have distinct headers and footers. A PDF loader is like a person whose job is to read that magazine page and transcribe just the text, ignoring the irrelevant parts and trying to keep the reading order logical.\n",
